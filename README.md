A Smart Security Door System designed in Raspberry Pi 4 with an ultrasonic sensor, a camera module, temperature and humidity sensor that can be installed at the entrance of the house. 

A supervised machine learning that detects if it is a person or an object that is approaching or leaving the door. Strangers that approaching the door and do not leave will be recorded and notify the owner via an application that can be installed in smartphone.
